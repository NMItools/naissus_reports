Description
---
In order to determine the exact amount of water that is produced and distributed to consumers, it is necessary to perform continuous, simultaneous, and systematic measurements of basic hydraulic quantities: flows and pressures. Systematic measurements of flows and pressures, among other measures, enable the detection of losses and the possibility to create measures that will reduce losses in the distribution network. Without measurement, successful modeling, monitoring and other types of analysis that are the basis for the development of the system and rationalization in it are almost impossible.
