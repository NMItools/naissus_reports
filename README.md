Description
---
A very common situation with out-of-the-box and commercial desktop GIS software solutions is that it does not support the specific needs of users. This problem was solved by creating the MapBasic user application. 

**MapBasic** is a programming language that allows you to extend the functionality of a famous desktop GIS software _MapInfo Professional_ by creating additional tools, functions, etc.

In addition to the fact that the user application is designed to facilitate user authorization and manipulation of the tables (GIS data layers) stored in the _MSSQL server_, 
it also contained the first tools that were adapted to some of the workflows of the various services in JKP "Naissus" like construction/design, approvals, consumption analysis, water meters, etc.
